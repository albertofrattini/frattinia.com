                    This website is the very first one that I created. I didn't
                    know nothing about HTML, CSS and JS before. And this what
                    happening only in 2019. My collaborator: Gabriele
                    Ghiringhelli.

                    Wanting to practice more the knowledge I acquired while
                    creating Libreggiamo project, I decided to create this
                    website to help my friends and I in the Fantasy football
                    auction.

                    This is the <i>visible outcome</i> of my Master Thesis.
                    Through the use of React and Node, I created this platform
                    where people can record their voice and listen to others'
                    with the purpose of collecting and validating samples lately
                    used in Emotional Speech Recognition.
