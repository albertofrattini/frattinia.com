In a world where spreading your own ideas can be the source of some else knowledge, a blog is something that many people, and among them
developers, are pursuing. In this article I am going to explain a really easy method to build your own blog with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, two
incredible tools that are becoming more and more used by Front-end developers.

This article is part of my own blog that I've been writing with the technologies we are going to use today, so you can expect 
to get the same result. I will not start from the basics: I will suppose you know how to use React.

First of all, we need to create a project and install the important dependencies that will be used by Next.js to create the 
blog posts. The following command will create a default Next.js project with everything necessary to start writing code:

```js
npx create-next-app my-blog
```



```js
npm install tailwindcss
npm tailwindcss init -p
npm install postcss-preset-env --save-dev
```

These three commands will add tailwindcss to `package.json` and create two required files: `tailwind.config.js` and 
`postcss.config.js`, a file to add tailwindcss as a plugin in the build chain. Installing then `postcss-preset-env` will 
translate PostCSS into CSS that most browsers can understand. After installation, we need to add plugins in `postcss.config.js`. 
The final content will look like this:

```js:postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
    plugins: ['tailwindcss', 'postcss-preset-env'],
}
```

Once we deploy our code, we would like the CSS file to be as small as possible. Tailwind, if we don't specify it, will leave us
with a giant CSS file that can slow down the load process of our blog, thus possibly bother visitors that will immediately leave it.
In order to avoid this problem we can apply a small but fundamental change. We need to add this lines of code inside the 
`tailwind.config.js` file:

```js:postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
    ...
    purge: {
        enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
        content: ['components/**/*.js', 'pages/**/*.js', 'templates/**/*.js'],
    },
    theme: {
        ...
    }
}
```

With this command, Tailwind will know which files to look in when searching for unnecessary CSS code to remove when the environment
is production, that is when we will deploy our code. I will later show you how to ensure that this will happen we we will perform
the deploy on Vercel.

In order to make Next.js understand how to render the content of `.mdx` files we will create, we need to specify where the template
of each article can be found and other information alongside it. To do so, let's create a new file in the root and call it `next.config.js`.
Inside this file, paste this code:

```js
const readingTime = require('reading-time')
const mdxPrism = require('mdx-prism')
const withMdxEnhanced = require('next-mdx-enhanced')

module.exports = withMdxEnhanced({
    layoutPath: 'templates',
    defaultLayout: true,
    remarkPlugins: [require('remark-code-titles')],
    rehypePlugins: [mdxPrism],
    extendFrontMatter: {
        process: (mdxContent) => ({
            wordCount: mdxContent.split(/\s+/gu).length,
            readingTime: readingTime(mdxContent),
        }),
    },
})({
    webpack: (config) => config,
})
```

With this code, we are exporting a IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that will be automatically triggered when Next.js
will import this file for configuration purposes. Passing the above object to the function `withMdxEnhanced`, we can: specify the 
folder in which there will be found the template of the article; add some plugins, such as `remark-code-titles` for adding titles 
to code snippets; add information to the frontMatter of each article, such as word count and reading time that we can subsequently 
display in our article.

After doing this, we can add the `templates` folder in the root of the project and add inside it a `index.js` file. This file
is the defaultLayout that will be used to create the article. Inside of this file let's add this code:

```js
import React from 'react'

const BlogPost = ({ frontMatter, children }) => {
    return (
        <article>
            <h1>{frontMatter.title}</h1>
            <p>
                {
                    frontMatter.author + ' - ' +
                    frontMatter.date + ' • ' + 
                    frontMatter.readingTime.text
                }
            </p>
            {children}
        </article>
    )
}

export default BlogPost
```

Now we need to prepare our blog page and, for simplicity, we can make that all our posts will be available on the home page. However, 
before changing that file, we need to add a new folder called `blog` inside `pages/` and add a new `.mdx` file in it. 
Let's call it `first-post.mdx` and paste this inside it:

```js
---
title: 'My First Blog Post'
author: 'My Name'
date: '2020-11-15'
type: 'article'
summary: 'Put here some words that describe your article'
---

This is my first post in my new Next.js and Tailwind CSS blog!
```

Now we need to import this post on the home page and, in order to do so, we can use the `pages/index.js` file. Let's open it and paste this:

```js:pages/index.js
import React from 'react'
import Post from '../components/Post'
import { frontMatter as blogPosts } from './blog/**/*.mdx'

const Home = () => {
    const renderedPosts = blogPosts.map((frontMatter) => {
        const {
            title,
            date,
            summary,
            readingTime,
            __resourcePath: path,
        } = frontMatter

        const slug = path.replace('.mdx', '')

        return (
            <Post
                key={frontMatter.title}
                title={title}
                additionalInfo={`${date} • ${readingTime.text}`}
                href={slug}
            >
                {summary}
            </Post>
        )
    })

    return (
        <>
            <h1>Blog</h1>
            <p>
                This is where my posts are listed and can be clicked to read the entire article.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>All Posts</h2>
            {renderedPosts}
        </>
    )
}

export default Home

```

The way we import all the posts present in the `/pages/blog/` folder will not be accepted by the compiler and an error will be thrown.
The reason is simple, we don't import a bunch of files like this in React, thus we need to change the configuration of our bundler: Babel.
If you don't know what a bundler is, I suggest you to check it out because it is the foundation on which React and other Frameworks
are built on. In order to change the configuration, we need to create a new file `.babelrc` in the root of the project and paste this inside
it:

```js
{
    "presets": ["next/babel"],
    "plugins": ["import-glob-array"]
}
```

Now that we got rid of that annoying error, we can start thinking about the other error that will pop up: there is not component
called `Post` because there is not the file `../components/Post.js`. So let's go and create it! Create a new file in `components` 
and call it `Post.js`. Inside it, paste this code:

```js
import React from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'

const Post = ({ href, title, additionalInfo, children }) => {
    return (
        <Link href={href}>
            <a>
                <div>
                    <h3>{title}</h3>
                    <p>{children}</p>
                    <p>{additionalInfo}</p>
                </div>
            </a>
        </Link>
    )
}

export default Post
```

Now our home page will be ready and it will have there listed all our posts.
